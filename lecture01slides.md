# lter Example:Nice Numbers
## Nice Numbers
**Definition:** A nice number doesn't have 98, 99 , 01, or 02 among its digits and 00 can only be followed by more 0's.
These numbers are nice enough already and unaffected: 755 2859 45622895
Implement nice, which takes a positive integer n. It returns the nearest nice number to n
- For numbers that end in 98 or 99 or 01 or 02, round to the nearest 100.
- Look for 98 or 99 or 01 or 02 among the digits that aren't at the end.

## Designing Functions
### Describing function
- A **function's domain** is the set of all inputs it might possibly take as arguments.
- A **function's range** is the set of all output values it might possible return.
- A **pure function's behavior** is the relationship it creates between input and output.
  ### A guide to designing function
  Give each function exactly one job, but make it apply to many related situations.

## Higher-Order Functions
### summation exmaple

### Program Design
- **Modularity**
- **Abstraction**
- **Separation of concerns**
### Twenty-one Rules
## Function as return values\

### locally defined functions
